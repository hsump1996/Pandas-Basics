# Overview

-Analyzing Manhattan properties sold in 12-month time period
-A data cleaning / transformation project of your choice with pandas

## Part 1 - Manhattan Properties Sold Sep 2018 to Aug 2019

-Imported rollingsales_manhattan.csv as a DataFrame

-Displayed columns and row samples

-Described the rows and data types

-Initial column (or row) clean-up

-Determined the top three neighborhoods that had the most properties sold (no need to calculate units, the actual number of properties is adequate)

-Described the kind of buildings that were sold

-Calculate summary statistics for the prices of properties sold for all of Manhattan and for a couple of select neighborhoods

-Bin the prices of properties sold

-Created a visualization the shows the relationship (if any) between the price sold and the number of square footage of all the areas of a property within a building or a structure

## Part 2 - Freeform Pandas Project

1. Retrieved the data, created a DataFrame

2. Using the Data

-Repeated the same analysis that I did previously in plain python, but with pandas instead
